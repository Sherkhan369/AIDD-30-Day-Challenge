# Reflection

Today I learned what AI-Driven Development means. AI is not replacing developers. Instead, it helps us work faster and smarter. AI can write code, fix errors, and give ideas, but I am the one who checks the work and makes the final decisions.

The October 2025 Turning Point showed that coding is not only about typing syntax. It is about thinking, planning, and working with AI like a partner. Developers now need good reasoning skills and the ability to guide AI with clear prompts.

In the future, humans and AI will work together. AI will handle speed and automation, and humans will bring creativity and logic. I feel excited about this new era because it makes development easier and more powerful.
